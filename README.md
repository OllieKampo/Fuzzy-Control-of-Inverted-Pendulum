# Fuzzy Control of Inverted Pendulum

A prototype educational Java application which favours experiential learning of fuzzy logic and PID control on a simulation of the inverted pendulum on a cart system.
The repository contains both the raw Java code and pre-compiled jar files to run the application directly.

This program was written during my masters thesis, for which I received a first class degree with honours.
